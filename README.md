## About me :v:

Hello, I'm a creative front-end developer based in Indonesia :indonesia:

I'm currently learning Full-stack in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer) and three.js with [this guy](https://github.com/brunosimon) ðŸŒ±

Check out my ongoing project, [Mixin' Jam](https://izamghali.github.io/mixin-jam/), a React web app where you can:
- search for songs, artists, and albums from Spotify
- mix and add those songs into your new personalized playlist
- and add that new playlist into your Spotify playlist

Check out my [three.js journey](https://izamghali.github.io/threejs-practice/) as well!
