## About me :v:

Hello, I'm a creative front-end developer in training based in Indonesia :indonesia:

I'm currently learning three.js and React ðŸŒ±

Check out my ongoing project, [Mixin' Jam](https://izamghali.github.io/mixin-jam/), a web app where you can:
- search for songs, artists, and albums from Spotify
- mix and add those songs into your new personalized playlist
- and add that new playlist into your Spotify playlist
